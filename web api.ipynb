    "Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life\n",

    "API is an abbreviation for Application Programming Interface which is a collection of communication protocols and subroutines used by various programs to communicate between them. A programmer can make use of various API tools to make their program easier and simpler. Also, an API facilitates programmers with an efficient way to develop their software programs. Thus in simpler terms, an API helps two programs or applications to communicate with each other by providing them with the necessary tools and functions. It takes the request from the user and sends it to the service provider and then again sends the result generated from the service provider to the desired user. \n",
    "EXAMPLE= We can take Zomato as an example to explain the concept of an API. Zomato receives a request for an order, the customer can track the driver’s location. Here, the API functions in this way- the Zomato app integrates with Google Map where after integration, google maps help you to track the location.\n",
    "Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "Advantages of APIs \n",
    "•\tEfficiency: API produces efficient, quicker, and more reliable results than the outputs produced by human beings in an organization.\n",
    "•\tFlexible delivery of services: API provides fast and flexible delivery of services according to developers’ requirements.\n",
    "•\tIntegration: The best feature of API is that it allows the movement of data between various sites and thus enhances the integrated user experience.\n",
    "•\tAutomation: As API makes use of robotic computers rather than humans, it produces better and more automated results.\n",
    "•\tNew functionality: While using API the developers find new tools and functionality for API exchanges.\n",
    "Disadvantages of APIs \n",
    "•\tCost: Developing and implementing API is costly at times and requires high maintenance and support from developers.\n",
    "•\tSecurity issues: Using API adds another layer of surface which is then prone to attacks, and hence the security risk problem is common in APIs.\n",

    "Q3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Web API Is simply an API for the web. It is an API that can be accessed using the HTTP protocol. It can be built using Java, .nET, etc. It is implemented to extend the functionality of a browser, simplify complex functions, and provide easy syntax to complex code. \n",
    "The four main types of web APIs are:\n",
    "•\tOpen API\n",
    "•\tPartner API\n",
    "•\tInternal API\n",
    "•\tComposite API\n",
    ">>\n",
    "Web Services\tWeb API\n",
    "Web services are a type of API, which must be accessed through a network connection.\tAPIs are application interfaces, implying that one application can communicate with another application in a standardized manner.\n",
    "Web service is used for REST, SOAP and XML-RPC for communication.\tAPI is used for any style of communication.\n",
    "All Web services are APIs.\tAPIs are not web services.\n",
    "It doesn’t have lightweight design, needs a SOAP convention to send or receive data over the system.\tIt has a light-weight architecture furthermore, useful for gadgets which have constrained transmission capacity like smart phones.\n",
    "It provides supports only for the HTTP protocol.\tIt provides support for the HTTP/s protocol: URL Request/Response Headers, and so on.\n",
    "It is not open source, however, can be devoured by any customer that comprehends xml.\tIt is an open source and also ships with .NET framework.\n",
    "Web service supports only XML.\tAPI supports XML and JSON.\n",
    "Web Services can be hosted on IIS.\tWeb API can be hosted only on IIS and self.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">> other types of APIs:\n",
    "•\tSOAP (SIMPLE OBJECT ACCESS PROTOCOL): It defines messages in XML format used by web applications to communicate with each other.\n",
    "•\tREST (Representational State Transfer): It makes use of HTTP to GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE data. It is basically used to take advantage of the existing data.\n",
    "Sortcoming of soap=SOAP does not support caching API calls.\n",
    "•\tSOAP is much more complicated than REST, which can have performance implications.\n",
    "•\tSOAP is much less adaptable than REST.\n",
    "•\tSOAP is usually slower than REST.\n",
    "•\tSOAP is used only XML format data in web service, whereas JSON and other lightweight formats are not supported by it.\n",
    "•\tIt is slow because it uses XML format, whereas the payload for a simple string message is large.\n",
    "•\tThere are no security features in the SOAP specification.\n",
    "•\tThere is no state reference for the remote object in the SOAP client.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Differentiate between REST and SOAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP vs. REST\n",
    "SOAP\tREST \n",
    "SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol with specific requirements like XML messaging\tREST (Representational State Transfer) is a set of guidelines (architectural style) offering flexible implementation\n",
    "Heavier and needs more bandwidth\tLightweight and needs less bandwidth\n",
    "It defines its own security\t.It inherits security from the underlying transport\n",
    "It permits XML-based data format only\tIt permits different data formats such as plain text, HTML, XML, JSON, etc.\n",
    "SOAP calls cannot be cached\tREST calls can be cached\n",
    "Also, the major difference is that SOAP cannot make use of REST whereas REST can make use of SOAP. \n"
